# About this Branch
MetaNN contains a lot of new programming attempts, and its development process is also a process of continuous summary and improvement. I spent some time writing a Book (C++ Template Metaprogramming in Practice), summarizing some technologies related to metaprogramming in the development process. The code in this branch corresponds to the content in the book.

The evolution of MetaNN is not fast, but it has been going on so far. The evolution is carried out on the main branch. There will be more differences between the code of this branch and the main branch, and with the development, the difference will be more and more. If you want to read the book "C++ Template Metaprogramming in Practice" combined with code, you should pay attention to the code of this branch. If you want to get the latest code in MetaNN and compare it with the content discussed in the book, you should get the code in the main branch.

In addition to the differences in content, the compilation environment of the main branch and this branch is also different. This branch uses makefile to compile the code and has been tested on three environments (Ubuntu + GCC, Ubuntu + clang, windows + mingw-64). But the main branch uses CodeLite to organize the code and only tests on Ubuntu + GCC.
